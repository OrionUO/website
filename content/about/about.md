title: About the Project
---

CrossUO is an Open Source Ultima Online&reg; client - a hard-fork from OrionUO, ported to `Linux` and `MacOSX` by [fungos](https://github.com/fungos). The project is currently maintained by fungos, [Deuce](https://github.com/jokker23) and [Nirad](https://github.com/nirad).

The project aims to have a fully open cross-platform Ultima Online&reg; client compatible with different eras from the game.

The CrossUO Suite is composed of the game client, the game launcher and updater and (for the foreseeable future) a closed source scriptable game assistant similar to Razor.
