Currently the only closed source component, XUO:Asist is a full featured game assistant with macro and scripting support.

Making use of the powerful Qt scripting, a Javascript based scripting engine, XUO:Asist is extremely flexible enabling complex actions to be easily automated.

Check the scripting [documentation](http://docs.crossuo.com/scripting/scripting.html) for more details.
